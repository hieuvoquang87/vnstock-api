# Active Context: vnstock-api

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the planning phase, focused on establishing the foundational documentation and project structure before beginning implementation. The main focus areas are:

1. **Project Setup**

   - Establishing project documentation
   - Creating the Memory Bank structure
   - Setting up the basic repository structure

2. **Initial Planning**

   - Defining the API wrapper scope based on vnstock library capabilities
   - Planning the architecture and component design
   - Establishing development phases and milestones

3. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Understanding the vnstock library functionality
   - Identifying key API endpoints to implement
   - Defining authentication and security requirements

## Recent Changes

- Created project README.md with comprehensive overview
- Established Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined the multi-phase development approach
- Outlined system architecture and component relationships

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 MVP Preparation)

1. **Project Structure Setup**

   - Initialize Poetry project with pyproject.toml
   - Set up Makefile with common commands
   - Create basic directory structure

2. **Environment Configuration**

   - Set up development environment
   - Configure linting and code formatting
   - Create sample environment variables file

3. **Initial Code Implementation**
   - Create FastAPI application skeleton
   - Implement basic health check endpoint
   - Set up testing framework

### Short-term (Phase 1 MVP Implementation)

1. **Core API Development**

   - Create vnstock adapter module
   - Implement first REST endpoints
   - Set up OpenAPI documentation

2. **Testing Strategy**

   - Develop unit tests for adapters and services
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Configure test coverage reporting

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   - Configure automated testing
   - Set up code quality checks

### Medium-term (Phase 2-3 Planning)

1. **GraphQL Implementation Planning**

   - Research GraphQL schema design for vnstock
   - Plan resolver implementation
   - Design type system

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Design Redis caching implementation
   - Plan cache invalidation strategy
   - Define caching policies for different data types

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Design Decisions**

   - How closely should REST endpoints mirror vnstock function names vs. being more RESTful?
   - What authentication mechanism should be used for the MVP?
   - How to handle rate limiting in the initial implementation?

2. **Technical Considerations**

   - Should we use async or sync functions for the adapters?
   - How to handle long-running operations for historical data?
   - What error handling strategy should be used?

3. **Open Questions**
   - What is the expected load and traffic pattern?
   - Are there any specific performance benchmarks to target?
   - How frequently does the vnstock library update, and how to handle versioning?

## Current Development Phase

The project is currently in **Phase 0: Planning and Setup** before beginning the implementation of Phase 1 (MVP). The focus is on establishing a solid foundation and clear direction for the project.

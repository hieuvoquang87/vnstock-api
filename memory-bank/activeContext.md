# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus

- **Implementation of core services**: Building service and datasource layers with clear interfaces and implementations
- **API design and standardization**: Creating standardized API routes and response formats
- **Error handling and validation**: Implementing robust error handling across the application
- **Refactoring**: Moving away from monolithic scripts to modular components
- **Naming conventions**: Establishing and following consistent naming conventions
- **API-first approach**: Developing the API with FastAPI endpoints and user-friendly URL structures

## Recent Changes

1. Created project README.md, Memory Bank structure, and multi-phase development approach
2. Updated requirements to Python 3.12 and changed deployment strategy to serverless
3. Designed and implemented modular datasource architecture with factory pattern
4. Created initial service layer with standardized interfaces and implementations
5. Implemented mock data for GraphQL endpoints
6. Established formal Implementation Documentation Framework
7. Extracted listing capabilities into modular components and created listing endpoints
8. Removed unsupported methods (`search_symbols` and `get_symbol_details`) from VCI datasource implementation
9. Fixed abstract class issue by making methods optional in the base class rather than requiring all subclasses to implement them
10. Cleaned up method signatures by removing unnecessary parameters (`to_df`) from interface and implementations
11. Added data source abstraction with ListingDataSource abstract class and implementations for VCI, TCBS, and MSN
12. Implemented ListingService to act as a facade to the data sources
13. Created REST API v1 routes for the listing endpoints
14. Made search_symbols and get_symbol_details optional methods in ListingDataSource interface
15. Removed explicit implementations for unsupported methods in VCI datasource
16. Added proper error handling for unsupported methods returning 501 Not Implemented status
17. Updated documentation to clearly indicate which datasources support which endpoints
18. Added more comprehensive test coverage for data sources
19. Removed to_df parameter from all method signatures to simplify the API

## API Design Decisions

- Use REST for common data retrieval and GraphQL for complex, client-specific queries
- Standardized response format for all API endpoints with consistent error handling
- Support for multiple data sources with factory pattern and source query parameter
- Clear documentation of supported vs. unsupported features per data source
- Consistent route naming and HTTP verb usage
- API versioning (v1) built into URL structure
- Graceful handling of unsupported methods with NotImplementedError and 501 status codes
- Method signatures simplified by removing unnecessary parameters for better consistency
- Use of abstract base classes for data sources to allow for multiple implementations
- Services act as a facade to the data sources, providing a consistent interface
- REST API versioning (v1) to allow for future changes
- Optional parameters provided with sensible defaults
- Consistent error handling via HTTP status codes:
  - 200: Successful operation
  - 400: Bad request (invalid parameters)
  - 404: Resource not found
  - 500: Server error
  - 501: Method not implemented by the current datasource

## Implementation Documentation Framework

Documentation is organized by feature area in the `memory-bank/implementation/` directory:

1. **Architecture**: Overall system architecture, design patterns, and component relationships
2. **API**:
   - REST: Endpoints, parameters, response formats
   - GraphQL: Schema, queries, mutations
3. **Services**: Service layer interfaces and implementations
4. **Datasources**: Data source implementations and interfaces
5. **Models**: Data models, schemas, and validation
6. **Utilities**: Shared utility functions and helpers

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- Implement remaining service capabilities (financial data, price data, etc.)
- Create comprehensive test suite for all components
- Complete API documentation for all endpoints
- Optimize performance for data-intensive operations
- Plan and start Phase 2: Advanced Features, including GraphQL implementation

### Future Phases

- **Phase 2: Advanced Features**

  - GraphQL API implementation
  - Data caching and optimization
  - Advanced analytics endpoints
  - Authentication and rate limiting

- **Phase 3: External Services**
  - Email notifications
  - Integration with external platforms
  - Scheduled reports
  - User preferences and customization

## Tasks in Progress

1. Implement TCBS data source
2. Implement MSN data source
3. Add authentication to the API
4. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Improve documentation with examples

## Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility: Each component has a clear, well-defined purpose
2. Open/Closed: Systems are open for extension but closed for modification
3. Interface Segregation: Clients don't depend on methods they don't use
4. Dependency Inversion: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

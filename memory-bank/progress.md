## What Works

- Initial project documentation established
- Project structure planned with detailed file organization
- Development phases defined
- Memory Bank created for ongoing documentation
- Serverless architecture designed
- Implementation documentation structure created
- FastAPI application skeleton set up
- Listing datasources implemented and organized by source
- Listing service implemented with business logic
- Listing API routes implemented with FastAPI
- Error handling and logging established
- Module structures established with proper naming conventions
- Documentation updated for implementation components

## What's in Progress

- Implementing remaining API endpoints
- Creating remaining services
- Adding unit tests for existing components
- Updating documentation for new implementations
- Adding OpenAPI schema documentation
- Configuring serverless deployment

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: MVP (Current Phase)

- [ ] Complete remaining REST API endpoints (financial, quotes, company, etc.)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling across all endpoints
- [ ] Implement testing framework with serverless testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with serverless deployment
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Create corresponding implementation documentation files for remaining modules
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add caching mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize response times
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: GraphQL API

- [ ] Design GraphQL schema
- [ ] Implement resolvers
- [ ] Set up GraphQL Explorer interface
- [ ] Set up GraphQL documentation
- [ ] Extend test coverage to GraphQL
- [ ] Document GraphQL implementation details

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Set up Redis Cloud integration
- [ ] Implement Supabase/PostgreSQL for historical data
- [ ] Add cache invalidation mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize query performance
- [ ] Tune serverless configuration for performance
- [ ] Document caching and optimization strategies

### Phase 4: AI Capabilities

- [ ] Implement MCP server integration
- [ ] Design natural language query interface
- [ ] Add AI-powered analytics
- [ ] Document AI capabilities and integration

### Phase 5: Productionization

- [ ] Implement API key management
- [ ] Add rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Create user registration system
- [ ] Implement usage tracking
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Optimize serverless costs and performance
- [ ] Document production features and configurations

### Documentation

- [x] Set up project structure for documentation
- [x] Created detailed documentation for API endpoints
- [x] Documented authentication approach
- [x] Created documentation template for implementation files
- [x] Set up documentation structure mirroring application code
- [x] Moved implementation docs from `docs/implementation` to `memory-bank/implementation`
- [x] Established formal Implementation Documentation Framework
- [x] Created listing service documentation
- [x] Created listing routes documentation
- [x] Updated documentation to follow naming conventions (routes.py)

## Known Issues

- Need to test API response time and performance
- Need to implement authentication approach for MVP
- Need to design database schema for historical data
- Serverless cold start times may be an issue with Python
- Need to evaluate cost implications of serverless deployment
- Need comprehensive testing for error handling

## Metrics and Goals

| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Code Coverage                  | >85%   | 10%     | In Progress |
| API Response Time (non-cached) | <200ms | -       | Not Started |
| API Response Time (cached)     | <50ms  | -       | Not Started |
| Cold Start Time                | <1s    | -       | Not Started |
| Documentation Completeness     | 100%   | 70%     | In Progress |

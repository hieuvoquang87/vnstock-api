## What Works

- Initial project documentation established
- Project structure planned
- Development phases defined
- Memory Bank created for ongoing documentation

## What's in Progress

- Finalizing architecture decisions
- Researching vnstock library capabilities
- Planning initial API endpoints

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 0: Planning (Current Phase)

- [ ] Initialize Poetry project structure
- [ ] Create Makefile for development commands
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting configuration
- [ ] Complete analysis of vnstock functionality

### Phase 1: MVP (Next Phase)

- [ ] Create FastAPI application skeleton
- [ ] Implement vnstock adapter layer
- [ ] Design and implement REST API endpoints
- [ ] Add OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Implement testing framework
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add basic error handling
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

### Phase 2: GraphQL API

- [ ] Design GraphQL schema
- [ ] Implement resolvers
- [ ] Set up GraphQL documentation
- [ ] Extend test coverage to GraphQL

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Set up Redis caching
- [ ] Implement Supabase/PostgreSQL for historical data
- [ ] Add cache invalidation mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize query performance

### Phase 4: AI Capabilities

- [ ] Implement MCP server integration
- [ ] Design natural language query interface
- [ ] Add AI-powered analytics

### Phase 5: Productionization

- [ ] Implement API key management
- [ ] Add rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Create user registration system
- [ ] Implement usage tracking
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## Known Issues

- No code has been written yet
- Need to research vnstock library to understand full functionality
- Need to determine authentication approach for MVP
- Need to design database schema for historical data

## Metrics and Goals

| Metric                         | Target | Current | Status      |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Code Coverage                  | >85%   | 0%      | Not Started |
| API Response Time (non-cached) | <200ms | -       | Not Started |
| API Response Time (cached)     | <50ms  | -       | Not Started |
| Documentation Completeness     | 100%   | 30%     | In Progress |

# Memory Bank: Companies API Implementation

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented a complete Companies API for the vnstock-api project, providing access to Vietnamese company information through REST endpoints. The implementation follows the project's architecture and patterns, with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive documentation.

## Components Implemented

1. **Data Models** (`app/models/schemas/company.py`)

   - Created Pydantic models for company data (CompanyProfile, CompanyOfficer, Shareholder, etc.)
   - Models match the TCBS data structure found in sample data
   - Added appropriate type hints, aliases, and field descriptions

2. **Data Source** (`app/datasources/company_datasource.py`)

   - Implemented CompanyDataSource abstract interface
   - Created VnstockCompanyDataSource implementation with placeholder data
   - Added DataSourceFactory for creating data source instances
   - Implemented error handling with try-except blocks

3. **Service Layer** (`app/services/company_service.py`)

   - Implemented CompanyService with methods for all company data types
   - Added data transformation methods for standardization
   - Used dependency injection pattern for data sources

4. **REST API** (`app/api/rest/v1/companies.py`)

   - Created RESTful endpoints for all company data operations
   - Added proper parameter validation and error handling
   - Used FastAPI's dependency injection for services
   - Standardized response format

5. **Router Integration** (`app/api/rest/v1/__init__.py`)

   - Added companies router to the v1 API router
   - Set prefix to "/companies" and added appropriate tags

6. **Main App Integration** (`app/main.py`)

   - Added v1 API router to the main FastAPI application

7. **Documentation**
   - Created documentation for all components following project template:
     - `docs/implementation/models/company.md`
     - `docs/implementation/datasources/company_datasource.md`
     - `docs/implementation/services/company_service.md`
     - `docs/implementation/api/rest/v1/companies/README.md`

## Endpoints Implemented

The following endpoints were implemented in the Companies API:

- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/info` - Comprehensive company information
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/profile` - Company profile
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/officers` - Company officers/management
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/shareholders` - Major shareholders
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/insider-trading` - Insider trading data
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/subsidiaries` - Company subsidiaries
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/events` - Corporate events
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/news` - Company news
- `GET /api/v1/companies/{symbol}/dividends` - Dividend history

## Data Structure

The company data structure is based on the TCBS sample data format with the following main components:

- **Company Profile**: Basic company information (name, exchange, industry, etc.)
- **Company Officers**: Management team and their ownership
- **Shareholders**: Major shareholders and their ownership percentages
- **Insider Trading**: Transactions by insiders (buying/selling shares)
- **Subsidiaries**: Companies owned by the main company
- **Events**: Corporate events (meetings, dividends, etc.)
- **News**: News articles related to the company
- **Dividends**: Dividend payment history

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to VNStock Library**: Replace placeholder data with actual calls to the vnstock library
2. **Implement Caching**: Add Redis caching to improve performance
3. **Add Authentication**: Implement API key authentication for endpoints
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **Pagination**: Add pagination support for list endpoints
6. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
7. **GraphQL Integration**: Add GraphQL schema and resolvers for company data

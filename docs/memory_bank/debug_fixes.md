# Memory Bank: Debug Fixes

## Import Error Fix

### Issue Description

When starting the FastAPI application, the server would not start due to the following error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'router' from 'app.api.rest.v1.stocks' (unknown location)
```

The error occurred because the application's `app/api/rest/v1/__init__.py` file was trying to import routers from modules that didn't exist or didn't have router objects defined:

```python
from app.api.rest.v1.stocks import router as stocks_router
from app.api.rest.v1.market import router as market_router
from app.api.rest.v1.companies import router as companies_router
```

### Fix Applied

1. Created the missing `stocks.py` file with a basic router implementation:

   - Added a `router` object exported by the module
   - Implemented a placeholder endpoint for `/api/v1/stocks/{symbol}/price`
   - Used the standard API response format with data and meta sections

2. Created the missing `market.py` file with a basic router implementation:

   - Added a `router` object exported by the module
   - Implemented a placeholder endpoint for `/api/v1/market/indices`
   - Used the standard API response format with data and meta sections

3. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created `docs/implementation/api/rest/v1/stocks/README.md` with API documentation
   - Created `docs/implementation/api/rest/v1/market/README.md` with API documentation
   - Maintained the same documentation standards as the Companies API

### Testing Verification

All API endpoints were successfully tested and are now working as expected:

- Root endpoint (`/`): Returns API information
- Stocks endpoint (`/api/v1/stocks/VNM/price`): Returns stock price information
- Market endpoint (`/api/v1/market/indices`): Returns market indices
- Companies endpoints (`/api/v1/companies/VNM/profile`, etc.): Return company information

The Swagger documentation is also accessible at `/docs` with status code 200.

## Next Steps

1. Implement full service layers for the stocks and market endpoints
2. Connect the placeholder data to actual vnstock library calls
3. Add more endpoints to the stocks and market APIs
4. Implement proper error handling for all endpoints
5. Add authentication and rate limiting

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check for the existence of imported modules before running the application
2. Create scaffolding for all required routers even if they're not fully implemented
3. Follow the established API response format across all endpoints
4. Ensure proper documentation for all API endpoints for better maintainability
